## **The Scenario: SkoolTek B2B Marketing Profit Model**

SkoolTek is an all-in-one AI and Blockchain-integrated school management platform. To grow its customer base, SkoolTek runs **paid social media advertising campaigns (Facebook and LinkedIn)** targeting **school administrators** who book demos and decide whether their schools will adopt the platform. This is a **B2B marketing scenario**, where revenue is earned per student, but the **customer acquisition cost (CAC) is incurred per school**. The goal is to model **marketing profit** using a linear function.

## **The Variables**

* **x** \= Number of **schools acquired through marketing**  
* **Price per student per year** \= ₱1,000  
* **Average number of students per school** \= 500

Revenue per school= 500 × ₱1,000 \= ₱500,000

**Marketing Cost Assumptions (Based on Spiralytics PH Data):**

* **Average Facebook CPC \= ₱105.28**  
* **Average LinkedIn CPC \= ₱ 130.18**  
* **Blended average CPC:**

  **105.28+130.18​2= ₱ 117.73**

**B2B Funnel Assumptions:**

* **Click → Lead \= 5%**  
* **Lead → Demo \= 20%**  
* **Demo → Paying School \= 10%**  
  **Clicks per school \=1​0.05 x 0.20 x 0.10= 1,000 clicks**  
  **CAC per school \=1,000×₱117.73=₱ 117,730**  
  


**The Function**

**f (x)=\[(1,000×500)−117,730\]12x \- 50,000**

 **f(x)= 31,855.83x−50,000**

**Where:**

* **f(x)= Monthly marketing profit**  
* **x \= Number of schools acquired per month**  
* **₱31,855.83 \= Monthly contribution per school**  
* **₱50,000 \= Monthly fixed marketing expense**
